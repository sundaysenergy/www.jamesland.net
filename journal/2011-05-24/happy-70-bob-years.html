            <p>Last week I was watching over my parents' house, and happened to catch Prince's interview &amp; performance on "Lopez Tonight".&nbsp; It was definitely good to see his <em>Princeness</em> again, especially considering how great he still looks &amp; sounds. He's even still hitting all the high notes in "The Beautiful Ones", with pretty much the same sound overall.&nbsp; For me, as a sometime singer, that's a great thing to hear...</p>  <p>And just when I'm thinking that Prince is the greatest Minnesota musician <em>ever</em>, along comes Bob Dylan's 70th birthday :) And again the Dylan memories &amp; music come to mind... It's funny <u>now</u> to think that I didn't really discover Bob Dylan until I was out of college. I mean, sure I'd heard of him.... But when the secretary where I worked in college told me she went to high school with him, I could only muster a youthfully exaggerated interest.</p><p>Only after I'd graduated and started playing in a band did I actually begin digging in, curious about what I'd find....&nbsp; At the time I was living in Minneapolis, so one morning (after working the night shift) I went to the Minneapolis Central Public Library. Within this massive structure, there was a <strong>huge</strong> selection of books on Dylan!</p><p>I picked out about 6 titles: a couple biographical, a couple with an academic perspective, and a couple mainly on the lyrics/poetry. I also visited the Electric Fetus in St. Cloud, and bought every album through John Wesley Harding on cassette.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, I added everything from "Blood on the Tracks" through "Infidels". And so, there at work, all by myself in a small St. Paul Kinko's store, I passed the time reading up and listening to those cassettes through the cheap boombox at hand.</p><p>And after a while I starting "getting it", and have been a fan ever since! At first, my favorite album was "The Times They Are A Changin'". I really liked the way those spare folk songs came across, with their intricate lyrics and captivating delivery. After that, I went through all the acoustic albums, then 'moving' to the amazing trio of electric albums (starting with "Bringing It All Back Home"). And for a while, at work, it was 'all Dylan all the time'.&nbsp; :)</p> <p>A few years later, in 1999, I went to see him live at Canterbury Park on that <a href="http://boblinks.com/dates11.html#0605">summer tour</a> with Paul Simon. I remember at the show he played mainly the hits, but did them in a sort of contemporary pop-folk style, totally different than on the albums.&nbsp; Usually, a song would start, and you wouldn't know for sure which one it was until he started singing the words :D</p><p>I remember he also played a lot of lead guitar that night, which one of the people I was with later wished hadn't been the case! Anyway, I left feeling like I preferred to experience his music through the album format, preferably in a room w/ a nice stereo...</p><p>After that the time passed, and I naturally moved along and got into other musics....&nbsp; And sometimes it's all too easy to forget about a onetime "passion". So that's why I think it's so great that people are making a big deal of this birthday. We need to be reminded sometimes!&nbsp; So today I read the first <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bob-dylan-talks-a-raw-and-extensive-first-rolling-stone-interview-90618/" target="_blank">interview</a> Dylan ever gave to Rolling Stone, along with an interesting slideshow on <a href="https://www.nme.com/photos/bob-dylan-the-stories-behind-70-of-his-greatest-songs-1427587" target="_blank">the stories of 70 songs</a>.</p><p>The only other thing I'd like to mention right now is that the first Dylan song I <em>really</em> got into was "Knocking on Heaven's Door". However, it was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8OHybVhQwc" target="_blank">Guns and Roses version</a>. So here is a live, "unplugged" version from the man himself:</p> <div align="center"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJpB_AEZf6U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>  </div>
