        	<div class="node-author">Posted by jim</div>
            <p>A few years ago, I had a blog on the now-deceased aqua-balloon.com website. At the time, I thought it'd be a good idea to write about some of dreams I had while sleeping.&nbsp; When the blog went down, though, I noticed that this didn't happen very often....</p><p>... In any case, I think a small part of me still thinks it's kind of a good idea.&nbsp; And so on this Easter sunday (add symbolism to taste), I'm going to muse over a dream I had a couple nights ago.&nbsp; But before that, here's a brief background...</p><p>Back in 2007 -- and running until mid-2009 -- I was trying very hard to come up with a suitable (and good) band name for this music.&nbsp; But I just couldn't decide on something I liked.&nbsp; And even when I thought I did have something, usually the next day I realized it didn't work for one reason or another.</p><p>I thought the coolest thing would be to literally dream up a name, like how John Lennon on occasion said the name "Beatles" came from a dream (it turns out <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A378669">that wasn't true</a>).&nbsp; But at the time I believed it - and in any case, it sure made for a good story.</p><p>So i tried to will myself a dream that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">would clearly give me</span> <strong>a name</strong>, and there were a few times when it did basically happen.&nbsp; The one most clear was "We Come Tuesday", which I didn't like much when I was awake.&nbsp; Most of the time, though, I could <em>kind of</em> remember a dream - but it wasn't clear what the name was aftewards. ("New Spirals" was an example of that.)</p><p>So eventually I settled on "James Land", which I thought of in a kind of dreamy mood ;)...&nbsp; And finally -- after about 6 months of "making sure" -- I went with it.&nbsp; Well, now that the album and website etc. have all been made, there's no easy way (or reason) to change it.&nbsp; These days, I happily don't think about band names much anymore (other than for fun and out of sheer habit).</p><p>However, the other night I had a dream which probably would have become my "band name" if it'd happened earlier.&nbsp; In this dream I was talking with my Dad about my grandmother's maiden name. I learned (to my surprise) that her last name originally was "Cody".&nbsp; And when I heard that, something clicked to me in the dream and I thought: 'That would make a good band name - Jim Cody'!</p><p>I also remember somehow comparing that name with "James Land" - and sort of preferring Jim Cody because it had a nice percussive sound to it.&nbsp; Then this intermingling of dream &amp; reality sort of brought me out of the dream (though I was still asleep).&nbsp; And as I started "coming to", I realized that my grandmother's maiden name was actually "Nelson".</p><p>Upon waking, I laid there and tried to make sense of it. But I couldn't. It just seemed to be another example of something that seemed good in a dream, but didn't quite add up in waking life.&nbsp; And so I guess the best thing I can say is that "James Land" has survived yet another challenge.&nbsp; But maybe I'll find another way to use that name sometime....</p>  </div>
