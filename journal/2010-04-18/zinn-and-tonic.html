            <p>I must admit (in lieu of something more interesting to write about) that last night my personal "spring cleaning" <em>may</em> have come to an end.&nbsp; I use the word "may" here because the spirit of the idea lives on.&nbsp; But the letter of it was broken, as it just made too much <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sense</span> not to throw back a few beers....</p><p>And in truth, this was the second time that I technically broke this resolution.&nbsp; The first happened on Friday, April 2nd, as I was sitting in the Turf Club in St. Paul. I was there because one of my favorite bands of recent years, the Ruby Suns, were going to play there that night.&nbsp; I'd bought a ticket back in January (right when they went on sale), and there was no way I was missing this show.</p><p>Going into it, I <em>did</em> have the intention of just drinking water.&nbsp; But when I showed up at around 8:30 p.m., the bands were nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; Knowing only that the doors opened at 8, I wasn't sure how long of a wait it would be.&nbsp; It was pretty chilly outside, though, and I didn't relish the thought of walking around or generally going someplace else...</p><p>So I sat down at the bar and looked up at the TV screen, which just began showing the movie "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gidget_(film)" target="_self">Gidget</a>".&nbsp; And when the bartender asked me what I wanted to drink, an answer of beer was just too perfect not to utter!&nbsp; Eventually, at around 10 p.m. the opening act began, and I nursed that beer just about up to that point (and followed it with a water).</p><p>Later, while the Ruby Suns were setting up on stage, another beer was purchased.&nbsp; In my defense, it *was* the first time finally getting to see a band I'd listened often and was really looking forward to hearing (not to mention it wasn't too packed and I could get up close).&nbsp; Again - a very cool occasion perfectly suited to a (2nd) beer.</p><p>Afterwards, the main "sun" Ryan was hanging around talking to people, and he was a very cool guy.&nbsp; We did chat a bit, and I even gave him a copy of After the Fact"!&nbsp; He accepted it with kindness and some enthusiasm, and told me they would listen to it in the van :)</p><p>Anyway -- for different reasons -- last night was another such night where it all just seemed too perfect...&nbsp; But today I did have to wake up to the double hangover from alcohol and knowing I'd sorta lapsed (again) on my goal.&nbsp; As I lay in bed, it gradually became noon, and I turned on KVSC for "<a href="http://alternativeradio.org/" target="_self">Alternative Radio</a>" (which I try to catch every Sunday).&nbsp; It was another excellent show - an interview with Howard Zinn.</p><p>There's nothing like a historian to put things in perspective, and especially Howard Zinn.&nbsp; This show presented the last recorded interview before his death.&nbsp; In it, he read his commencement address to Spelman College in 2005.&nbsp; I find it to be very moving and thought-provoking, and a great way to change the subject.&nbsp; So thanks for reading, and please now <a href="http://www.crmvet.org/comm/zinn05.htm" target="_self">read this</a> instead.</p>  </div>
