 <title>disappearing dove...</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-10-09/disappearing-dove</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the ADATs went down again about 2 months ago. One night the LCD characters suddenly melted digitally in front of my eyes! As it happened, I was on a roll - with only 3 songs left. But when the old LCD screen went bye-bye, it (surprisingly) brought the entire system down. So there was 2 months where I couldn&#039;t really do much work on the album....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-10-09/disappearing-dove&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Deer and Cows in the Road!</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-10-01/deer-and-cows-road</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I must say - in the last couple weeks there&#039;s been two &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;surprising&lt;/em&gt; animal encounters while driving in my car...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) It was Friday, the 23rd of Sept, and I was driving &quot;home&quot;&amp;nbsp;at dusk&amp;nbsp;on a county road near Clearwater. &amp;nbsp;Now, the stretch I was on is very straight, and somewhat hilly, and usually driven around 55 mph... So I was driving up to the top of a hill, and just as I was about to descend &lt;strong&gt;something&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(big) caught my eye in the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-10-01/deer-and-cows-road&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Right as Rain (in progress)</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-08-30/right-rain-progress</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed it&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve last blogged...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Started a new (part-time) job, which I like a lot, but that sometimes takes up a good 10 hours per day...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There&#039;s been a lot of shows I&#039;ve done lately with other bands...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Am pretty sure i&#039;m going to continue on w/ music in a different way...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-08-30/right-rain-progress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>&quot;After the Fact&quot;, Take 2!</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-08-03/after-fact-take-2</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s amazing how you can think about something so much for so long, and come to what you think is a very solid conclusion. And then in one shot of insight, you change your perspective and things look (and sound) very different...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-08-03/after-fact-take-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>New Spotify Impressions</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-07-29/new-spotify-impressions</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So I got an invite to the new U.S. Spotify release last Saturday, and after using it for a few days here&#039;s what I&#039;m thinking.&amp;nbsp; My only &lt;a href=&quot;/journal/2010-06-16/lala-cloud&quot;&gt;past experience&lt;/a&gt; with this kind of music streaming service was LaLa.com. I really enjoyed the free option, where you could stream entire albums, EPs, etc. (and all in a consequence-free environment ;). Of course it had a massive catalog, and the ability to view user comments (which were often worth reading)...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-07-29/new-spotify-impressions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Introducing: &quot;Cliff Notes&quot;</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-07-04/introducing-cliff-notes</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;When I think back on the time period when I was writing and recording the songs in &quot;After the Fact&quot;, I&#039;d probably sum it up as a time of trying things out and seeing what would happen.&amp;nbsp; I had already been through what I suppose could be thought of as the initial phase of songwriting: The pure thrill of listening to something that you&#039;d created.&amp;nbsp; This often is seen in bedroom-type music, recorded on a 4-track using minimal equipment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-07-04/introducing-cliff-notes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Halfway to Boxing Day</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-06-27/halfway-boxing-day</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, i just noticed an interesting coincidence. So I&#039;ve just completed my best (current) mix of &quot;Boxing Day&quot; for the upcoming album.&amp;nbsp; And I must say it took a good 3 evenings, at about 3 hours a session, to mix the song to its current &quot;JB Final Mixes&quot; state...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-06-27/halfway-boxing-day&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>FS: Minnie Winnie</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-06-03/fs-minnie-winnie</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago, I was &lt;a href=&quot;/journal/2010-03-13/wtb-pulse&quot;&gt;dreaming of a Pulse&lt;/a&gt;. But there wasn&#039;t one around, and after a while I sorta forgot about it....&amp;nbsp; Of course, the original thing I wanted, from the time i was a kid, is a Minnie Winnie :) We used to see them sometimes at campgrounds when we traveled around on family trips, and I always liked the way they looked....&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-06-03/fs-minnie-winnie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <title>Happy 70 Bob Years!</title>
 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-05-24/happy-70-bob-years</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I was watching over my parents&#039; house, and happened to catch Prince&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/q8fBcI0YL4E&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/s68P-GS4lyw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;performance&lt;/a&gt; on Lopez Tonight.&amp;nbsp; It was definitely good to see his &lt;em&gt;Princeness&lt;/em&gt; again, especially considering how great he still looks &amp;amp; sounds. He&#039;s even still hitting all the high notes in &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;, with pretty much the same sound overall.&amp;nbsp; For me, as a sometime singer, that&#039;s a great thing to hear...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-05-24/happy-70-bob-years&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

 <link>http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-04-26/jim-dash</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;So, a few months ago (on &lt;a href=&quot;/journal/2010-12-21/shortest-day-year-notes&quot;&gt;Winter Solstice&lt;/a&gt;) I had this &quot;feeling&quot;, and mentioned that &lt;em&gt;perhaps&lt;/em&gt; I may release my latest songs under a different name.  And after/before that evening, it&#039;s been floating around in the back of my mind...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesland.net/journal/2011-04-26/jim-dash&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
